<p style="font-size:30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immunefi PoC Templates</p>

This is a collaborative repository that aims to provide reusable and easily modifiable PoC examples for a variety of EVM based vulnerabilities. This will increase the quality of bug reports and allow whitehats an easier, faster way to create PoCs and verify their claims. These templates are intended for testing proof of concepts in local forks for submission to bug bounty programs. Any other use is explicitly prohibited.

## Overview

### Installation

Foundry is required to use this repository. See: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.

### Getting Started üìñ

1Ô∏è‚É£ First, set up the interfaces for the protocol you will be creating a PoC for. You can create your own interface contracts, or download the contracts for the protocol using Foundry's [`cast etherscan-source`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-etherscan-source) command line tool. Define the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable, then call
```
cast etherscan-source [address] -d src/external
```
This will download the contracts' source code to `src/external`, where you can simply import any contract interfaces by adding the following to the top of your PoC.
> ##### *üö® When downloading source code from deployed contracts, there may be remappings that need to be modified for the source files to compile. Add any necessary remappings to [`remappings.txt`](./remappings.txt).
```
import "./external/ExampleProtocol/ExampleEtherscanContract.sol"
```
Optionally, append `--chain [chain_name]` to specify a chain other than the Ethereum mainnet to download contracts from. **Note:** you will have to update your Etherscan API key when switching between different chains.
<br>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Pick a PoC [template](#template-categories-) and modify the template file which extends* from the corresponding source contract. Within the template contract, there will be comments describing how you can modify the PoC to fit your vulnerability. 

> #####  *üö® When extending from an abstract contract, there will be functions which must be defined. Implement any undefined functions with your attack.
<br>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Once you have completed your attack contract, navigate to the corresponding [test](./test) file, import your attack contract, and modify the `setUp()` to replicate any necessary attack preconditions, such as forking from a network, initializing accounts with certain balances, or creating any other conditions which are necessary for the attack. Try to keep your setup as **close** to mainnet state as possible. The more the setup differs from the mainnet state, the harder it is for projects to verify your claims. Now, you're ready to run your PoC!

### Running a PoC üöÄ

To use a template, run the following in the console:
```
forge test -vv --match-path test/[test_name]
```
